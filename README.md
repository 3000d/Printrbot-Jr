Printrbot-Jr
============

Everything to make your own Printrbot Jr v1 in Europe (we adapted the design for metric parts).

Roadmap
-------

* Add the BOM from European suppliers
* Add Slic3r config files
* Correct the sketchup model file

How to use
--------

* Lasercut the files in `lasercut_files` folder with 6mm wood (birch or MDF, don't use soft plywood)
* Print the parts in `print_files` folder
* Use our BOM (yet to come) to buy electronics, hardware and fasteners
* Assemble the machine using our guide (french) : [http://d3000.dozuki.com/Guide/Montage+d%27une+Printrbot+Jr+v1/1](http://d3000.dozuki.com/Guide/Montage+d%27une+Printrbot+Jr+v1/1)
* Use our slic3r config file to slice STL files
* Print !
